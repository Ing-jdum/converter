This readme was mostly written by chatgpt

Converter-app is a currency and temperature converter application developed as part of the Oracle Next Education and Alura Program ONE. The app allows users to convert between different currencies and temperature units using a modern MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. It also includes a comprehensive set of JUnit Jupiter tests for ensuring the correctness of the conversion logic.

## Features

- Currency Conversion: Convert between different currencies using up-to-date exchange rates.
- Temperature Conversion: Convert between different temperature units including Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- MVVM Architecture: Follows the MVVM architectural pattern with some changes to simplify it given the ease of the app. this in order to separate concerns and improve code maintainability.
- JUnit Jupiter Tests: Includes a set of unit tests using JUnit Jupiter to verify the accuracy of conversion calculations.
- Oracle Next Education and Alura Program ONE: Developed as a challenge project for the educational programs.
